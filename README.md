Bench - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
===========================================================

Bench is a fork of [Git](https://github.com/git/git), a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

Bench is an Open Source project covered by the GNU General Public License version 2 (some parts of it are under different licenses, compatible with the GPLv2). Git was originally written by Linus Torvalds with help of a group of hackers around the net. Bench extends Git with support for arbitrary large files. It was originally written by Saman Amirpour Amraii at GitBench Inc.

Please read the file [INSTALL][] for installation instructions.
